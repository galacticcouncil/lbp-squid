     * this should be higher than final weight
     * - `final_weight`: Final weight of the asset_a. 1_000_000 corresponding to 1% and 100_000_000 to 100%
     * this should be lower than initial weight
     * - `weight_curve`: The weight function used to update the LBP weights. Currently,

     * - `fee`: The trading fee charged on every trade distributed to `fee_collector`.
     * - `fee_collector`: The account to which trading fees will be transferred.
     * - `repay_target`: The amount of tokens to repay to separate fee_collector account. Until this amount is
